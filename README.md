# rshell
Atticus VanArsdale

rshell is a command-line driven user interface based on bash. rshell works with most commands not explicitly built into bash. rshell functions as expected: it takes in a command line, formats the input into individual commands, then runs said commands using forking depending on conditionality. 

Known bugs:
-cannot handle certain connectors not seperated by spaces
-cannot handle comments without '#' padded by spaces
